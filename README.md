# TensorFlowObjectDetectionTutorial

This is a "short" (rather lengthy) tutorial that started off as self notes on how to set-up and get going with the TensorFlow Object Detection API.

To read the actual to tutorial, you have the following 2 (more like 3) options:
1. Visit tfobjectdettut.readthedocs.io. (By far the easiest)
2. Clone/Download the repo:
   - Open the "index.html" files under docs/build/ (Not guaranteed to be up-to-date)
   - Build the docs using Sphinx and the open "index.html" (Guaranteed to be up-to-date)
